# Trigger Step Job on File state change

## Event Description
Triggers a job to create STEP for parts and assemblies when released. All other file types will be ignored.
In comparison with a powerJobs job, there will be no job added to the Vault Job Queue, when the file extenions doesn't fit. This can reduce the number of jobs in the Job Queue enormously.
